title: Promoting Your App By Deliberately Making Your Website Worse
---

## Examples
### Taobao
  * Clicking search results on the mobile version of the website takes you to the app download page.
  * Certain coupons/vouchers can only be used in the app.

### Xianyu
  * Website does not provide search functionality.
    * If you look into the website's HTML, you can clearly see the search form, commented out.
    * Uncomment the form and you'll get a fully functional search box.
  * Pics of the item in detail page are blocked by a QR-code image (which takes you to the app download page) until manually dismissed.
